# What color is your function

#techadvice

- Color of function is race condition. (Async/Sync)
- You cannot call Async(red) from sync(blue) making it problem and
  you've to turn the function to red color/async
- #javascript and many have this async and sync color issue
- #golang completely eliminates it with their [[Goroutines]]

## Fun bit

- Author uses [[Blub]] to not offend the reader of this
  article.
