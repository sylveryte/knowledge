# Python Operations

- Arithmetic Operators have more priority than Conditional
  Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

- `9+3`
- `+ - * / %`
- `**` exponent(E)
- if even one float then result is float
- `/` returns float
- `//` returns int for divide
- `int+float` fine
- `(x+y)*z` order BEDMAS

## Conditional Operators

- core `== != <= >= < >`
- additional //todo

## Chain Conditions

- `and or not` instead of `&& || !`
- `a = True or 3==4`
- order is from first to last `not > and > or`
